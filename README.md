Projects using the TM4C123 microcontroller

## Description
This repository includes the work in my embedded systems class which has various hardware that works with the TM4C123 microcontroller. Each project will include a report and the necessary files to run the program. The report includes steps to recreate the project, a lab demonstration link, theory of how the system works, hardware designs which includes schematics, and software designs that includes code explanation and flow charts. Keil uVision was used to program the TM4C123 MCU and occasionally paired with TeraTerm (terminal emulator program).

All these projects utilize core microcontroller concepts such as interrupts, GPIO, hardware timers, UART, SSI, WiFi, etc...
